  - Attach debuggers.
  - Deploy test artifacts.

Flow diagram (conceptual)
1. CLI starts host process.
2. Host reads configuration.
3. Host initializes policy engine.
4. Host spawns runtime(s).
5. Loader fetches scripts and verifies signatures.
6. Runtime exposes whitelist API to scripts.
7. Script executes under quota and policy.
8. Telemetry streams events to sink.

Design principles
- Minimally privileged: Host limits what scripts can do.
- Auditable: Emit clear, structured logs for every sensitive call.
- Modular: Swap components without refactoring core logic.
- Deterministic: Ensure predictable runtime behavior in test runs.

Security and responsible use
This document focuses on research and testing practices. Do not use this toolkit to perform unauthorized actions. The project provides mechanisms to enforce safe use. The code and artifacts are for controlled environments.

Guidelines
- Use isolated networks and VMs for test runs.
- Run all releases in disposable or sandboxed images.
- Require signatures for production-like runs.
- Keep logs for every execution and retain them for audits.
- Limit runtime privileges to minimum required by the test.
- Use explicit consent forms before any test on third-party assets.

Threat model (short)
- Malicious scripts: Scripts may try to escape or consume resources.
- Supply-chain risk: Build artifacts must be validated and reproducible.
- Insider misuse: Apply access controls to CI and release paths.

Hardening steps
- Apply strict file system permission controls.
- Run host in a low-privilege account.
- Use containerization for trial runs.
- Enable network egress filtering.
- Regularly audit binaries and dependencies.

Release assets and download
The project publishes binary and archive artifacts on the releases page. Visit the releases page at:
https://github.com/FelipeGoulart-dev/DX9WARE-Roblox/releases

If you use an artifact from that page, handle it with care. Only deploy builds in controlled test environments. The assets contain compiled binaries and support files. The typical asset names follow the pattern:
- DX9WARE-Roblox-vX.Y.Z-win.zip
- DX9WARE-Roblox-vX.Y.Z-linux.tar.gz
- DX9WARE-Roblox-vX.Y.Z-source.zip

Release artifact verification
- Check the provided checksums.
- Validate GPG signatures if present.
- Rebuild from source to confirm reproducibility when possible.

Installation (research environment)
This section lists a safe setup for local testing. The steps avoid production instructions.

Prerequisites
- A modern desktop OS or a VM host.
- Docker (optional).
- A disposable test account.
- Basic build tools for source builds.

Local VM setup
1. Create a new VM image.
2. Apply OS updates.
3. Install required dev packages.
4. Add a non-privileged user for running the host.

Containerized run (recommended for testing)
- Build a minimal Dockerfile that runs the binary inside a contained environment.
- Apply network policies and resource limits.

Known caveat
- Do not expose the host to public networks without a proper access gateway.

Configuration
Configuration uses clear key-value files and JSON or YAML payloads. The repository includes sample config files under /config.

Typical configuration keys
- runtimes: list of runtime definitions.
- runtime.name: unique id.
- runtime.memory_limit_mb: numeric limit.
- runtime.cpu_quota_ms: per-tick limit.
- runtime.api_whitelist: list of approved host APIs.
- loader.paths: allowed script directories.
- telemetry.endpoint: local socket or file.

Example (conceptual)
runtime:
  name: research-01
  memory_limit_mb: 128
  cpu_quota_ms: 20
  api_whitelist:
    - math
    - table
loader:
  paths:
    - /srv/scripts
telemetry:
  endpoint: unix:///tmp/dx9ware.sock

Configuration loader
- The host loads defaults.
- It merges environment overrides.
- It validates values against a schema.

Runtime and Lua environments
This section explains the runtime model at a conceptual level. It avoids instructions that enable misuse.

Runtime lifecycle
- init: Host allocates state and applies policy.
- load: Scripts and modules load via the loader.
- run: Execution occurs under quota and audit.
- snapshot: Host can snapshot state for analysis.
- shutdown: Host cleans up resources.

Lua state management
- Each runtime gets a dedicated Lua state.
- The host pins the state to a thread.
- The host intercepts calls to sensitive functions.
- Use of debug and ffi is controlled by policy.

Exposed host APIs (examples)
- host.log(message)
- host.metrics(name, value)
- host.storage.read(key)
- host.storage.write(key, value)
- host.event.emit(name, payload)

API rules
- The host enforces whitelists.
- Each API call creates an audit event.
- APIs may present sanitized views to scripts.

Script and module API (high level)
The project exposes a minimal interface to scripts. The goal is to let scripts perform logic without direct system control.

Basic script lifecycle
1. Script author packages code with manifest.
2. Loader verifies manifest and checks signature.
3. Script receives an execution context object.
4. Script registers handlers with the host.
5. Host triggers handlers on events.

High-level examples (pseudo)
- Register an init handler:
  function init(ctx)
    ctx.log("start")
  end
- Respond to events:
  function on_event(ctx, ev)
    if ev.type == "tick" then
      ctx.metrics("tick", 1)
    end
  end

Module packaging
- Modules include metadata (name, version, hash).
- The loader resolves dependencies inside allowed paths.
- Use only approved external modules.

Scripting best practices
- Keep scripts short and focused.
- Fail fast on unexpected data.
- Emit structured telemetry.
- Avoid long-running tight loops; use cooperative yields.

Plugin and extension model
The host supports binary and script plugins. The model focuses on safe extension.

Plugin types
- Host plugins
  - Extend host capabilities.
  - Run under host privileges.
- Runtime plugins
  - Provide additional APIs to Lua.
  - Run under runtime constraints.

Plugin lifecycle
- install: Host registers the plugin.
- validate: Host runs validation checks.
- enable: Host activates the plugin.
- disable: Host unloads the plugin.

Plugin signing
- Hosts should accept signed plugins only.
- Validate plugin manifests during install.

Testing and CI approach
The project integrates tests that exercise safety features and the loader. The tests avoid external networks and real-world targets.

Test categories
- Unit tests for core logic.
- Integration tests for loader and runtime.
- Fuzz tests for input parsers.
- Resource tests for limits and quotas.
- Policy tests for whitelist rules.

CI hints
- Run tests in containers.
- Use artifact signing for release workflows.
- Archive logs for every test run.

Troubleshooting
Common signals
- Host fails to start: Check config schema and permissions.
- Runtime stops unexpectedly: Inspect telemetry and quotas.
- Module load fails: Verify loader paths and signatures.

Log collection
- The host writes structured JSON logs to disk.
- Use jq or other tools to filter events.

Debugging tips (high level)
- Reproduce runs in a VM snapshot.
- Increase telemetry level temporarily.
- Capture a snapshot to inspect the Lua state.

Legal and ethical boundaries
This project aims to support research and authorized testing. It does not support or endorse abuse. Do not use these tools to perform unauthorized tests or to bypass protections on services you do not own.

Trouble with releases
Visit the releases page if you cannot find a build artifact or checksums:
https://github.com/FelipeGoulart-dev/DX9WARE-Roblox/releases

If an asset is missing, open an issue on the repo to request re-upload. The releases page contains the canonical artifacts.

Operational best practices (research labs)
- Maintain a change log for runs that affect test subjects.
- Automate snapshots before and after tests.
- Rotate keys and credentials used by the loader.
- Segregate telemetry storage per experiment.

Audit checklist for runs
- Is the runtime config documented?
- Are scripts signed?
- Is the host running with minimal privileges?
- Are logs collected and tamper-evident?

Ethical script authoring
- Avoid third-party data collection.
- Filter out personally identifiable data.
- Respect robots and rate limits when interacting with external services.

Telemetry and observability
Design telemetry for clarity and audit. Use structured events for actions such as:
- script.load
- script.verify.signature
- runtime.create
- api.call
- quota.exceeded

Telemetry format (example)
{
  "ts": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "event": "script.load",
  "script": "example.lua",
  "result": "ok"
}

Privacy considerations
- Do not record sensitive data in telemetry.
- Mask or hash identifiers before storage.

Localization and internationalization
- Keep messages short and neutral.
- Externalize user-facing strings.

Performance considerations
- Track per-runtime CPU and memory usage.
- Use batching for telemetry.
- Optimize loader cache hits.

Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Unbounded loops in scripts: Apply cooperative yield or tick patterns.
- Large memory allocation: Enforce memory_limit_mb.
- Excessive I/O: Provide rate-limited host APIs.

Examples and patterns (non-actionable)
Below are non-actionable code patterns that illustrate safe design. They do not enable exploitation.

Example: structured logging
function safe_log(ctx, key, value)
  ctx.log({key = key, value = value})
end

Example: cooperative yield pattern
-- Pseudo: yield control to host to avoid long blocks
function work(ctx)
  for i=1,100000 do
    if i % 1000 == 0 then
      ctx.yield()
    end
  end
end

Example: manifest structure
{
  "name": "example-script",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "entry": "main.lua",
  "hash": "sha256:..."
}

Compatibility and porting notes
- Lua 5.1/5.3/5.4 compatibility: The runtime may target a specific Lua version. Check the runtime binding.
- Host bindings: Use the provided wrapper to avoid raw FFI exposure.

Third-party dependencies
- Lock and audit dependencies.
- Use minimal dependency surface.

Reproducible builds
- Provide build scripts.
- Publish checksums and signatures.

Known limitations
- The host cannot protect against physical access attacks.
- The policy engine is expressive but not formal-verified.
- The loader assumes a trusted delivery channel for manifests unless signatures are used.

Roadmap (example)
- Add formal policy language.
- Integrate remote attestation mechanisms.
- Expand platform support.

Glossary
- Host: The external supervising process.
- Runtime: A single Lua state with policy.
